# i-gotta-clean-up-some-repos-later-today-and-tomorrow--no-worries--gottaFocusOnImportantThings

* i have to email some ppl i dont want them poking around on my github

letters requested, i just need jim's work email so i asked him bc the app says i cant use his gmail -- I WILL GET THEM IN by the next couple of weeks, ill keep emailing my letter writers to get them in ASAP

im closing all the repos except for like 3 i gotta super focus now this and i dont want evil eye i want things to happen smoothly

1 out of 3 letters are in, im trying to push them all to submit them this week

i get a little stressed out working on this app bc u know it has to be perfect and everything, like im planning for the next few yrs and beyond in the personal statement, so i may not update this everyday bc im just thinking about my app and writing things down and ideas, and i dont want to share them bc i dunno who is out there and with what intentions, its very complicated, its not personal

2 out of 3 letters are in as of an hr ago. so the 3rd writer is not responding ... YET it hasnt been a week so i get it, but they were responding to my emails over the summer and i see their github pushes as of yesterday soooo i gotta give it another week
